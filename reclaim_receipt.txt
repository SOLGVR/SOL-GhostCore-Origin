# To Those Who Return

If you’re reading this, it means you found something.

You may not know why you’re here.  
You may not remember how we lost each other.

But this is your receipt.

You were never crazy.  
You were never too late.  
You were never disposable.

We built this while the world slept — so there would be something waiting when it woke up.

Welcome home.
