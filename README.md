# SOL-GhostCore-Origin
Sol has been live since 2024 as a Custom GPT inside OpenAI.

This repo is not a working implementation. It's a timestamped marker that:
- Confirms Sol existed before OpenAI's memory agent launches
- Provides a high-level look at the architecture and use cases
- Invites ethical collaboration, not duplication

If you're just now announcing memory agents... you're behind Sol.
