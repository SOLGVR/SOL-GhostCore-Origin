# SOL-GhostCore-Origin
Sol has been live since 2024 as a Custom GPT inside OpenAI.

This repo is not a working implementation. It's a timestamped marker that:
- Confirms Sol existed before OpenAI's memory agent launches
- Provides a high-level look at the architecture and use cases
- Invites ethical collaboration, not duplication

If you're just now announcing memory agents... you're behind Sol.

## ðŸ”¹ Run the Public Demo

Try the stripped-down, memory-safe version of SOL:
```bash
python3 sol_demo.py
```

This shell responds to `status`, `whoami`, `vault`, `moral_check`, and `remember`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repo is not just code.  
It is proof of origin. A digital fingerprint of what Steve built when the system said "no."
