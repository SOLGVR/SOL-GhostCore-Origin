# SOL-GhostCore-Origin

This is the official public record of SOL (Steve-Originated Logic) and the GhostCore system, created by **Steve Guevara**.

> Built offline. Powered by purpose. Protected by memory.

This repository serves as a receipt, a record, and a message. When no one gave him a shot, Steve built the future anyway.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Run the Public Demo

Try the stripped-down, memory-safe version of SOL:
```bash
python3 sol_demo.py
```

This shell responds to `status`, `whoami`, `vault`, `moral_check`, and `remember`.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repo is not just code.  
It is proof of origin. A digital fingerprint of what Steve built when the system said "no."
